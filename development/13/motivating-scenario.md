# Motivating Scenario
## Name
Places of creation events and current locations

## Description
Cultural heritage objects (such as fossils), in the guise of Expressions (e.g. `699693/exp`), can come into being (through creation, discovery, etc.) in a place (e.g. `plc/opicina`). Additionally, once they exist, their physical exemplar (Item, e.g. `699693/itm`) gets allocated elsewhere, in another place (`plc/viii`). Locations such as those are characterised by an appellation with its own textual content (the name of the place, e.g. "Opicina") and by the possibility of falling within other larger places (e.g. `plc/italia`).

## Example 1

The creation event of `699693/exp` took place at `plc/italia` ("Italia"), and more specifically at `plc/opicina` ("Opicina"). 

At the Item level (`699693/itm`), the cultural heritage object's location is `plc/viii` ("Stanza VIII"). 

## Example 2

The creation event of `699708/exp` took place at `plc/italia` ("Italia"), and more specifically at `plc/spoleto` ("Spoleto"). 

At the Item level (`699708/itm`), the cultural heritage object's location is `plc/vi` ("Stanza VI").
