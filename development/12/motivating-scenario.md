Taxonomic classifications

## Description
Certain cultural heritage objects (such as fossils) are classified according to highly structured categories called _taxonomic ranks_ the objects show features of (e.g. a _Calycoceras Asiaticum_ shows features of _Animalia_ (Kingdom), _Mollusca_ (Phylum), _Cephalopoda_ (Class), _Ammonitida_ (Order), _Acanthoceratidae_ (Family), _Calycoceras_ (Genre) and	_asiaticum_ (Species)). Each rank has a textual content (e.g. _Animalia_) and a type representing the actual category (e.g. Kingdom). All these information can be found on external online resources that document that given cultural heritage object.
