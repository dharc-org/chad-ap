Descriptive components

## Description
Labels, types, and identifiers are all important components of managing and identifying cultural heritage resources in order to provide their comprehensive and accurate representation. 

`Descriptive labels` are textual descriptions assigned to a `cultural  resource` to help identify and distinguish it from other resources. `Types` are used to classify `cultural resources` into categories based on their characteristics. `Identifiers` are unique codes or numbers assigned to a `cultural resource` that provide a standardized reference to the resource. With respect to the collection, possible `types of identifiers` used for cultural resources include `volume number`, `project id`, `shelf mark`, and so on.

## Example 1
The creation event `01-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `01-man` ("Amerigo Vespucci sveglia l’America"). The cultural resource has the `identifier` "01" with `type` equal to `project id`. Its `type` is `print`. Its `descriptive label` is "Amerigo Vespucci sveglia l’America
 Amerigo Vespucci awakens a sleeping America
 In
 Jan van del Straet (Stradano), Nova Reperta, c. 1589 – c.1593, Antwerp
 Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum"

## Example 2
The creation event `05-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `05-exp` ("De Historia Animalium lib. 9"). The cultural resource has the `identifiers`:
* "05" with `type` equal to `project id`
* "9" with `type` equal to `volume number`
* "A.V.GG.VII.28" with `type` equal to `shelf mark`

Its `type` is `printed volume`. Its `descriptive label` is "Aristoteles
 De Historia Animalium lib. 9 
 Venezia, Girolamo Scoto, 1545
 BUB, A.V.GG.VII.28"

## Example 3
The creation event `45-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `45-exp` ("Dryas octopetala L."). The cultural resource has the `identifiers`:
* "45" with `type` equal to `project id`
* "13" with `type` equal to `volume number`
* "Erbario Aldrovandi, vol.13, carta 77" with `type` equal to `shelf mark`

Its type is `specimen`. Its `descriptive label` is "Dryas octopetala L.
