# Motivating Scenario
## Name
Curation and conservation

## Description
A `cultural resource` typically is characterized by at least a `curation event` that involves its management and preservation in a `collection`. The `agent` responsible for the curation of a cultural resource is typically tasked with preserving and protecting it for future generations. In addition, the `place` of conservation is where the object is physically located and cared for within the agent responsible for its conservation.

## Example 1
A `curation event` `L1-curation` - carried out by `Rijksmuseum` (located in `Amsterdam`) - curated the collection `Nova Reperta` for the `cultural resource` `L1-man` ("Amerigo Vespucci sveglia lâ€™America").

## Example 2
A `curation event` `1-curation` - carried out by `Sistema museale di Ateneo` (located in `Bologna`) - curated the collection `Collezione di Zoologia` for the `cultural resource` `1-man` ("Panthera leo (Linnaeus, 1758)").

## Example 3
A `curation event` `14-curation` - carried out by `Sistema museale di Ateneo` (located in `Bologna`) - curated the collection `Collezione di Anatomia comparata` for the `cultural resource` `14-man` ("Limulus polyphemus (Linnaeus, 1758)").
