# Cultural Heritage Acquisition and Digitisation Application Profile (CHAD-AP)

## Object Module (OM)
As shown in the diagram below, a Cultural Heritage (CH) object is described in CHAD-AP according to the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) data model, which uses several descriptive layers for its representation.

In particular, the _Work_ (`frbroo:F1_Work`) represents the _essence_ or conceptualization of the CH object. It begins with a conception event (`frbroo:F27_Work_Conception`) occurring within a specific time span (`crm:E52_Time-Span`), which can be expressed as either a precisely defined period with exact starting and ending date times (`crm:P82a_begin_of_the_begin` and `crm:P82b_end_of_the_end`) or a fuzzy label if its temporal extents are not precisely known (`crm:P82_at_some_time_within`). Each work is associated with a series of titles (`crm:E35_Title`), each classified according to a particular type (`crm:E55_Type`), which can be an _original title_ (`aat:300417204`) or an _exhibition title_ (`aat:300417207`). Furthermore, a Work can be part of a larger Work (`frbroo:F15_Complex_Work`), like a series of printed volumes, which is classified under a particular type (`crm:E55_Type`).

The _Expression_ (`frbroo:F2_Expression`) is the realisation of a Work, and refers to the intellectual _content_ of the object. It is generated through a creation event (`frbroo:F28_Expression_Creation`) made of smaller activities (`crm:E7_Activity`), each conducted by one or more agents (`crm:E39_Actor`) and characterised by a specific type (`crm:E55_Type`) that defines, implicitly, the role assumed by the agent for that activity. For example, if the agent is identified as the author of the Expression, the activity type is represented as _writing_ (`aat:300054698`). Also, creation events employ various creation techniques (`crm:E55_Type`). For example, `aat:300054196` is used to express _drawing technique_. An Expression can also be associated with one or more subjects defining its contents. In CHAD-AP, a generic _concept_ is represented with the class `crm:E73_Information_Object` with the type `aat:300404126` (i.e. _subject_) explicitly specified.

Finally, the _Manifestation Singleton_ (`frbroo:F4_Manifestation_Singleton`) represents the physical instance of the CH object. It is accompanied with descriptive components like labels (expressed through the use of the property `crm:P3_has_note`), types (`crm:E55_Type`), and identifiers (`crm:E42_Identifier`). In some cases, it may be linked to a curation activity (`crm:E87_Curation_Activity`) carried out by a keeper (`crm:E39_Actor`) who manages a collection (`crm:E78_Curated_Holding`) the object belongs to, and that is located in a specific place (`crm:E53_Place`). Manifestations can consist of other Manifestations and may depict the Expression of another related object, such as a video displaying a manuscript or a tablet showing a picture of a specimen. In addition, Manifestations are associated with copyright or licensing statements (represented through the combination of `crm:E73_Information_Object` having type `aat:300435434`, i.e.  _copyright/licensing statement_), linked with the document introducing the actual license or right statements through the property `crm:P70i_is_documented_in`. Whenever possible, instances of `crm:E39_Actor` and `crm:E53_Place` are also linked with existing authority records through the property `crm:P48_has_preferred_identifier`.

## Process Module (PM)
As shown in the diagram below, CHAD-AP also describes the entities for defining a 3D digitisation workflow as a sequence of activities classified according to two main categories. 

![A diagram of the CHAD-AP Process Module (PM).](diagrams/profile-model.png)

On the one hand, we have the _acquisition activity_ (`crmdig:D2_Digitization_Process`), which involves the digitisation of a CH object (`crm:E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing`) to produce its digital CH object (`crmdig:D9_Data_Object`). Similarly to its physical counterpart, the digital CH object can be associated with copyright statements or licenses (`crm:E73_Information_Object` with `aat:300435434` as its type). The acquisition occurs within a time span (`crm:E52_Time-Span`) with defined starting and ending date times, and engages various agents, including individuals (`crm:E21_Person`) and institutions (`crm:E74_Group`) responsible for the activity. During the acquisition, a series of techniques (`crm:E55_Type`) can be used, such as _photogrammetry_ (`aat:300053580`) or _structured light scanning_ (`aat:300391312`), along with tools (`crmdig:D8_Digital_Device`) like _digital cameras_ (`aat:300266792`) and _structured light scanners_ (`aat:300429747`).

On the other hand, we have a series of _software activities_ (`crmdig:D10_Software_Execution`), each representing a specific stage or phase of digitisation workflow. Such stage is denoted by its type (`crm:E55_Type`), such as _processing_ (`aat:300054636`), _modelling_ (`aat:300391447`), and _optimization_ (`aat:300386427`). It involves the manipulation of the digital CH object (`crmdig:D9_Data_Object`) produced previously as input and the production of a modified version of that digital CH object (`crmdig:D9_Data_Object`) as output. The activity also occurs within a defined time span (`crm:E52_Time-Span`) with precise start and end date times, engages various agents, including individuals (`crm:E21_Person`) and institutions (`crm:E74_Group`), and uses software as tools to produce its output (`crmdig:D14_Software`).
