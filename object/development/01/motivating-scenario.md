## Description
In many cases, the creation of a cultural resource is a collaborative process that involves multiple people. This is because cultural resources cover different formats and require a diverse range of techniques to bring them to fruition. In particular, a `cultural resource` is created in a `creation event`. A `creation event` may consists of other smaller `activities`, each carried out by one or more `agents` and characterized by a certain `type` that represents the agent's role. In addition, a `creation event` is carried out by using a certain `type` of creation technique.

## Example 1
The creation event `01-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `01-exp` ("Amerigo Vespucci sveglia lâ€™America") through the technique `engraving`. The creation event consists of three smaller creation events:
* `01-exp-creation-01`, carried out by `Jan van der Straet (ULAN:500011304)`, in the role of `illustration`;
* `01-exp-creation-02`, carried out by `Philip Galle`, `Theodor Galle` and `Jan Collaert`, in the role of `engraving process`;
* `01-exp-creation-03`, carried out by `Luigi Alamanni (ULAN:500714480)`, in the role of `commission`.

## Example 2
The creation event `35-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `35-exp` ("De plantis epitome utilissima") through the technique `watercolor`. The creation event consists of two smaller creation events:
* `35-exp-creation-01`, carried out by `Pietro Andrea Mattioli (VIAF:61549376)`, in the role of `translation`;
* `35-exp-creation-02`, carried out by `Pietro Andrea Mattioli (VIAF:61549376)`, in the role of `illustration`.

## Example 3
The creation event `24-exp-creation-00` created the cultural resource `24-exp` ("Panthera onca (Linnaeus, 1758)") through the technique `taxidermy`. The creation event consists of two smaller creation events:
* `24-exp-creation-01`, carried out by `Carl Linnaeus (VIAF:34594730)`, in the role of `discovery`;
* `24-exp-creation-02`, carried out by `Naturaliter`, in the role of `museum preparation`.
