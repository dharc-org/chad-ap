# Motivating Scenario
## Name
Existing digital resources

## Description
A cultural heritage object, such as a manuscript, comprises multiple physical and conceptual layers, encompassing the `work`, `expression`, `manifestation`, and `item` levels. In particular, it may also have an existing digital representation â€” such as a digitized version accessible through an online repository using Mirador. This digital resource serves as a `copy of` the cultural heritage object at the manifestation level, sharing some features with it.

Similarly enough, a data object (such as a digital 3D model used as an input during the optimisation phase of the digitisation process regarding a cultural heritage object) may be a `copy of` an existing data object that a researcher used as a blueprint to produce the former.

## Example 1
The manuscript with ID "52" comprises four layers:
* Work: `52/wrk`;
* Expression: `52/exp`;
* Manifestation: `52/mnf`;
* Item: `52/itm`.

It also has a digital representation, already existing in the AMS Historica repository, that can be found at this address: http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14008/78078.

## Example 2
The specimen with ID "16" comprises four layers:
* Work: `16/wrk`;
* Expression: `16/exp`;
* Manifestation: `16/mnf`;
* Item: `16/itm`.

During the digitisation process involving this item, it was decided to use an existing 3D model of a similar specimen as input, instead of acquiring the data directly from the original. In particular, the input for the optimisation phase was a copy of the existing data object, which can be found at https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cuban-macaw-nhmw-zoo-vs-50796-52348a29605a4136a0e807942d3c12a6.
