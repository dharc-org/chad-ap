# Objects of Aldrovandi's exhibition

## Description
An object or cultural resource that is part of Aldrovandi's exhibition is conceptualized according to FRBR:
* `frbroo:F1_Work` (the essence of the object). It is initiated in a conception event (`frbroo:F27_Work_Conception`), which is carried out by the actual author (`crm:E39_Actor`) within a certain period of time (`crm:E52_Time-Span`) characterized by a beginning and an end date. A Work is also characterized by a series of titles (`crm:E35_Title`). Finally, a Work may also be part of a larger Work (`frbroo:F15_Complex_Work`), such as a series of printed volumes, which in turn belongs to a certain type (`crm:E55_Type`).
* `frbroo:F2_Expression` (the intellectual content of the object). It is created in a creation event (`frbroo:F28_Expression_Creation`). A creation event may consists of other smaller activities (`crm:E7_Activity`), each carried out by one or more agents (`crm:E39_Actor`) and characterized by a certain type that represents the agent's role (`crm:E55_Type`). In addition, a creation event is carried out by using a certain type of creation technique (`crm:E55_Type`). In general, a creation event functions as a pivot point that connects Work, Expression and Manifestation. Moreover, an Expression can be characterized with one or more subjects related to its contents (`crm:E73_Information_Object`).
* `frbroo:F4_Manifestation_Singleton` (the object itself). It is characterized by a series of descriptive components, such as descriptive labels, types (`crm:E55_Type`) and identifiers (`crm:E42_Identifier`). When applicable, it is also related to a curation activity (`crm:E87_Curation_Activity`) carried out by a keeper (`crm:E39_Actor`), who curates a collection (`crm:E78_Curated_Holding`) the object is part of, located in a certain place (`crm:E53_Place`). A Manifestation can be composed of other Manifestations and can also depict the Expression of another object that is somehow related to it (e.g. a video displaying a manuscript is a Manifestation that is depicting another object's Expression; a tablet displaying the picture of a speciment is a Manifestation that is depicting another object's Expression; and so on).
