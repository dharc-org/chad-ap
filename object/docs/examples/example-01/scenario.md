Finally, it is part of the printed series Nova Reperta.
* at the FRBR level of Expression, the object has been created in a creation event by using engraving as a technique. The creation event is made up by three activities (illustration, carried out by Jan Van der Straet; engraving-process, carried out by Philip Galle, Theodore Galle and Jan Collaert; commission, carried out by Luigi Alamanni). A series of subjects are related to the expression itself: "astrolabio", "formichiere", "bradipo", "tapiro", "gruppo di cannibali" and "vessillo croce del sud".
* at the FRBR level of Manifestation, the object has been involved in a curation activity carried out by Rijksmuseum (located in Amsterdam) which curated the collection Nova Reperta. Moreover, the Manifestation is characterized by having an identifier ("L1"), a description, and a type (print).
