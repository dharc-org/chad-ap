# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 2)
## Name
Agents
## Description
Digitization processes and other software activities in a 3D digitization workflow usually involve `agents` - such as `people` and `intitutions` - that are responsible for carrying it out. For example, a activity such as "processing" - which refers to the manipulation and management of 3D data using specialized software or programming languages - is carried out by at least one person who belongs to a certain institution.

## Example 1
The object `ALD-15-proc-output` has been generated as an output during the processing activity carried out by the person `Federica Collina`, who belongs to the institution `UNIBO DBC`. The processing activity used the object `ALD-15-acq-output` (produced by the digitization process `ALD-15-acq`) as an input.
