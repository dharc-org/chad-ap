# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 3: Techniques and Tools)
## Name
Techniques and Tools
## Description
Digitization processes and other `activities` usually involve using `techniques` (such as photogrammetry or structured light scanning) and `tools` (like structured light scanners - e.g. Scanner Spider - and 3D scanning software - e.g. Artec Studio 14).

## Example 1
The physical object `15` has been digitally acquired through the `Structured Light Scanning` technique and the `Scanner Spider` tool. The digitization process produced a 3D model `15-acq-output` as an output.

## Example 2
The digital object `15-acq-output` has been digitally processed through the `Artec Studio 14` tool. The processing activity produced a 3D model `15-proc-output` as an output.
