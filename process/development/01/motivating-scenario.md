# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 1)
## Name
Digitization process
## Description
In a 3D digitization workflow there are digitization processes and software activities. A `digitization process` is used to capture 3D data of real-world objects or environments, such as cultural heritage objects. It digitizes a `physical object` and outputs a `digital object` that may be provided with a `license document`. A `software activity` uses this digital object as an input for further processes. They both take place within a certain `period of time`, characterized by a start date and a end date.

## Example 1
The object `ALD-15` has been digitally acquired on the 17th of April 2023. The digitization process produced a 3D model `ALD-15-output-acq` as an output provided with a "CC BY 4.0" license, which will be used as an input by the software activity `ALD-15-proc`.
