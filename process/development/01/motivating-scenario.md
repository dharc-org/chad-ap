# Motivating Scenario
## Name
Acquisition step
## Description
In a 3D digitization workflow there are digitization processes and software activities. A digitization process is used to capture 3D data of real-world objects or environments, such as cultural heritage objects. It digitizes a physical object and outputs a digital object that may be provided with a right statement documented in a document. A software activity uses this digital object as an input for further processes. They both take place within a certain period of time, characterized by a start date and a end date.

## Example 1
The object "32" has been digitally acquired on the 8th of May 2023. The digitization process produced a 3D model "32-output-acq" as an output provided with a "CC BY-NC 4.0" license, which will be used as an input by the software activity "32-proc".
